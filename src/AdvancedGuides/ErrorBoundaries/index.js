        <p>
          These two counters are inside the same error boundary. If one crashes,
          the error boundary will replace both of them.
        </p>
        <BuggyCounter />
        <BuggyCounter />
      </ErrorBoundary>
      <hr />
      <p>
        These two counters are each inside of their own error boundary. So if
        one crashes, the other is not affected.
